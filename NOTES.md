The following improvements can be made in subsequent iterations:

* Content markdown should be editable and persisted to a database somewhere
* Also accept addresses? (Does anyone not know their postcode and is this a fair prerequisite?)
* Postcode data should ideally be validated
* Error feedback in logical places - ie when the mapt/yournextmp APIs can't be contacted
* Animation to show AJAX activity
* Facebook/Twitter integration
