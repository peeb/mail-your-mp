   # Find Your MP

   ### This is the default copy for the Mail Your MP web tool.
   
   #### This copy is generated from [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), an easy-to-use markup language which generates HTML.

   The idea here is that any [38 Degrees](http://www.38degrees.org.uk/) campaigner can modify this content **relatively** easily without having to write any code or depend on anyone technical. The only knowledge required is a basic working knowledge of Markdown syntax.

   This is the place to put some explanatory blurb about why we made this tool and why you might want to use it.

   Use the postcode lookup tool below to find your MP.
